## Problem Statement
Project focuses on predicting ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties of drug-like molecules. These properties play a crucial role in determining a drugâ€™s efficacy and safety. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to enhance the prediction accuracy of pharmacokinetic properties, aiding in early-stage drug discovery.

# Data Set:
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicology - or ADMET - endpoints sit in the middle of the assay cascade and can make or break preclinical candidate molecules. For this blind challenge we selected several crucial endpoints for the community to predict:

**Mouse Liver Microsomal stability (MLM, protocol)**: This is a stability assay that tests how quickly a molecule gets broken down by mouse liver microsomes. This is a useful assay that can be used as an estimate on how long a molecule will reside in the mouse body before it gets cleared.

**Human Liver Microsomal stability (HLM, protocol):** This is a stability assay that tests how quickly a molecule gets broken down by human liver microsomes. This is a useful assay that can be used as an estimate on how long a molecule will reside in the human body before it gets cleared.

**Solubility (KSOL, protocol):** solubility is essential for drug molecules: this heavily affects the pharmacokinetic and dynamics ('PKPD') of the molecule in the human body.

**LogD (protocol):** like solubility - but then in fatty tissue - LogD is a measure of a molecule's lipophilicity, or how well it dissolves in fat. LogD is calculated by comparing a molecule's solubility in octanol, a fat-like substance, to its solubility in water.

**Cell permeation (MDR1-MDCKII, protocol):** MDCKII-MDR1 is a cell line that's used to model cell permeation i.e. how well drug compounds will permeate cell layers. For coronaviruses this is a critical endpoint because there is increasing evidence that afflictions such as long-covid are caused by (remnant) virus particles in the brain, and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeation is critical for drug candidates to reach the brain.
